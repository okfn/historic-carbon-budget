Historic Carbon Budget
======================
TODO write a more involved readme :-)

In 2050, we can use existing figures from the World Bank, and ($INSERT_SOURCE_HERE) to learn:

* how much Co2 we _should_ be emitting
* what the population will be
* the size of economy should be in USD/GDP

If there figures to be met, then our economy will have a certain degree of efficiency, in terms ofg CO2 needed generate a single UKP of GDP.

How efficient are we now with BAU though? How efficient are other companies?

For this project, we're looking at the historical trend to see how fast we're improving as a planet at generating a given amount of GDP, for a given amount CO2.
